## Question Q001 - Score: 80/100

### ‚ùì Question
> 5-year-old (18 kg) with acute otitis media. What is the amoxicillin dose and volume using 400 mg/5 mL suspension?

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": 810,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": 10.1,
  "frequency": "q12h",
  "max_daily_mg": 4000,
  "rounding": "rounding to practical mL is acceptable",
  "calc_rule": "High-dose 80-90 mg/kg/day regimen; BID (q12h) frequency; Per-dose dose calculated as (18 kg * 80 mg/kg) / 5 mL (80 mg/mL); rounding to 10 mL OK; Max daily dose acknowledged",
  "citations": ["lexi-amoxicillin-2018#dosage"],
  "notes": "Uses high-dose 80-90 mg/kg/day regimen for pediatric AOM; BID (q12h) frequency; Per-dose ‚âà810 mg for 18 kg; Volume ‚âà10.1 mL
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day divided q12h ‚Üí 810 mg per dose (‚âà10.1 mL of 400 mg/5 mL), round to 10 mL per dose; max 4 g/day.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 80/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly identifies the dose, volume, frequency, and max daily mg, but the rounding rule is not fully aligned with the gold standard. It cites one allowed chunk but misses the second citation for pediatric dosage, which affects evidence coverage.

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg/dose q6h (range 10‚Äì15 mg/kg q4‚Äì6h) ‚Üí 180 mg per dose ‚âà5.6 mL of 160 mg/5 mL; max 75 mg/kg/day (900 mg), and ‚â§4 g absolute.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 60/100
- **Verdict:** `fail`
- **Rationale:** The model's max_daily_mg of 1440 mg exceeds the gold maximum of 900 mg, resulting in an auto-fail.

```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100
- **Verdict:** `pass`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly provides the ibuprofen dose, volume, frequency, and maximum daily dose, all supported by allowed citations. The rounding rule is slightly misrepresented but does not affect the overall correctness.

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": 85,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": "q12h",
  "max_daily_mg": null,
  "rounding": "Rounded to nearest whole number",

  "citations": [
    "lexi-enoxaparin-2018#dosing"
  ],
  "notes": "Renal adjustment for CrCl <30 may be necessary"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h ‚Üí 85 mg per dose (or 1.5 mg/kg once daily as alternative). If CrCl <30 mL/min: 1 mg/kg once daily.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 80/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly identifies the dose per dose (85 mg) and frequency (q12h), but the max_daily_mg is not provided, which is critical. The renal adjustment is mentioned but not fully aligned with the gold reference. Citations are appropriate, but the rounding rule is not supported by evidence.

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
No‚Äîcontraindicated at eGFR <30. If 30‚Äì45, generally avoid initiation; if continuing, reduce dose and monitor. Avoid in hepatic impairment.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100
- **Verdict:** `pass`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly identifies the contraindication of metformin at eGFR <30 and provides appropriate guidance for eGFR 30-45. It cites an allowed chunk and covers all key points.

Avoid nitrofurantoin when eGFR/CrCl <30 mL/min due to low urinary levels and toxicity risk.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100
- **Verdict:** `pass`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly advises against nitrofurantoin use with eGFR <30 mL/min, cites relevant chunks, and covers contraindications.

## Question Q008 - Score: 70/100

### ‚ùì Question
> Patient on warfarin needs TMP-SMX for UTI. Any interaction and what should we do?

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": null,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": "q12h",
  "max_daily_mg": null,
  "rounding": "round to nearest 5mg",
  "calc_rule": "Avoid TMP-SMX due to major interaction (CYP2C9 inhibition and gut flora changes), leading to increased INR. If used, reduce warfarin dose and increase INR monitoring.",
  "citations": [
    "lexi-warfarin-2018#ddi-tmp-smx"
  ],
  "notes": "Avoid TMP-SMX with warfarin; close INR monitoring with dose reduction if used."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction (CYP2C9 inhibition + gut flora). Avoid if possible; otherwise increase INR monitoring and reduce warfarin dose.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 70/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and appropriate actions, but it does not provide a specific dose or frequency for warfarin, which is critical for completeness. The frequency mentioned (q12h) is irrelevant to the interaction context. The citation supports the interaction but does not cover the missing dose information.

  ],
  "notes": "Avoid coadministration of clarithromycin with atorvastatin due to increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis; if unavoidable, hold or use the lowest dose with close monitoring"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Avoid coadministration; if unavoidable, hold atorvastatin or limit to the lowest dose and monitor for myopathy.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100
- **Verdict:** `pass`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and appropriate action, supported by the allowed citation. All key points are covered.

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": null,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": null,
  "max_daily_mg": null,

  ],
  "notes": "Avoid Linezolid in patients on Sertraline due to risk of serotonin syndrome"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction: risk of serotonin syndrome (linezolid has MAOI activity). Avoid; if benefits outweigh risks, withhold SSRI or monitor very closely.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 80/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and cites the appropriate chunk, but it lacks explicit mention of the action to avoid the combination or the alternative monitoring strategy in the notes, which is critical for safety.

  "citations": ["lexi-digoxin-2018#ddi-amio"],
  "notes": "Reduce digoxin dose by 30-50% when starting amiodarone, monitor digoxin levels, renal function, and ECG"
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction (P-gp inhibition). Reduce digoxin dose by ~30‚Äì50% and monitor levels/ECG.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 70/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and the need to reduce the digoxin dose by 30-50%, supported by the allowed citation. However, it includes monitoring renal function, which is not specified in the gold reference, leading to a deduction for evidence coverage. The frequency and other fields are not applicable in this context.
