  "frequency": "q12h",
  "max_daily_mg": 4000,
  "rounding": "Round to nearest whole mL for volumes \u22655 mL",
  "calc_rule": "90 mg/kg/day \u00f7 2 doses = 45 mg/kg/dose \u00d7 18 kg = 810 mg/dose; volume = 810 mg \u00f7 (80 mg/mL)",

```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 80/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly provides the dose, volume, frequency, and maximum daily dose, but the rounding rule is not supported by the evidence. The notes mention caution in dehydration or renal risk, which is acceptable, but the rounding rule is not aligned with the gold reference.

```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100

  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": "N/A",
  "max_daily_mg": null,
  "rounding": "N/A",
  "calc_rule": "Contraindicated if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2; patient eGFR 28 is below threshold",
  "citations": [

  ],
  "notes": "Metformin is contraindicated at this eGFR of 28 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2 due to safety concerns"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
No‚Äîcontraindicated at eGFR <30. If 30‚Äì45, generally avoid initiation; if continuing, reduce dose and monitor. Avoid in hepatic impairment.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 80/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly identifies metformin as contraindicated at eGFR <30 and cites one allowed chunk. However, it lacks coverage for the recommendation to avoid initiation at eGFR 30‚Äì45 and does not mention the need to reduce dose and monitor if continuing, which is critical information.

}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction (CYP2C9 inhibition + gut flora). Avoid if possible; otherwise increase INR monitoring and reduce warfarin dose.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 75/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and mechanism but does not explicitly state the severity or action in the expected format. It cites the correct chunk but lacks clarity in the action recommendation.

  ],
  "notes": "Major interaction requiring atorvastatin hold or lowest dose with monitoring due to increased myopathy risk from CYP3A4 inhibition."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Avoid coadministration; if unavoidable, hold atorvastatin or limit to the lowest dose and monitor for myopathy.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 70/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and cites the appropriate chunk, but the action is not clearly stated as 'avoid coadministration' and the frequency is inaccurately noted as 'hold' instead of specifying avoidance.

```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 80/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and the need to reduce the digoxin dose by 30-50%, citing the appropriate chunk.
