## Question Q003 - Score: 75/100

### ‚ùì Question
> 12 kg child with fever: ibuprofen dose and volume using 100 mg/5 mL?

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": 120,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": 6,
  "frequency": "q6\u20138h",
  "max_daily_mg": 480,
  "rounding": "whole mL",
  "calc_rule": "10 mg/kg/dose",
  "citations": [

    "lexi-ibuprofen-2018#max"
  ],
  "notes": "Use oral suspension for pediatric dosing."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg/dose q6‚Äì8h ‚Üí 120 mg per dose (6 mL of 100 mg/5 mL); max 40 mg/kg/day (480 mg). Avoid if <6 months or dehydrated/renal issues.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 75/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly identifies the dose, volume, frequency, and max daily mg, but the rounding rule is incorrectly stated as 'whole mL' instead of '6 mL'. The notes contain a claim about using oral suspension, which is not directly supported by the cited chunks.

## Question Q004 - Score: 75/100

### ‚ùì Question
> Elderly patient with nonvalvular AF: 82 years, 58 kg, SCr 1.6 mg/dL. What apixaban dose?

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": 2.5,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": "q12h",
  "max_daily_mg": 5,
  "rounding": "none",
  "calc_rule": "2 of 3 criteria met: age \u226580 years, weight \u226460 kg, serum creatinine \u22651.5 mg/dL",
  "citations": [
    "lexi-apixaban-2018#dosing-nvaf"
  ],
  "notes": "Apixaban dose reduced due to age, weight, and renal function."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Apixaban 2.5 mg BID (meets 2 of 3: age ‚â•80, weight ‚â§60 kg, SCr ‚â•1.5). Avoid with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 75/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly identifies the dose of apixaban as 2.5 mg BID and cites the appropriate chunk for dose reduction criteria. However, it fails to mention the interaction with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors, which is a critical safety point. The max daily mg is correctly stated as 5 mg, but the rounding rule is not applicable here. Overall, the answer is mostly correct but lacks completeness in safety considerations.

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": 85,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": "q12h",
  "max_daily_mg": 170,
  "rounding": "nearest whole mg",
  "calc_rule": "1 mg/kg q12h",
  "citations": [
    "lexi-enoxaparin-2018#dosing"
  ],
  "notes": "Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h is the preferred regimen for acute DVT treatment in normal renal function."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h ‚Üí 85 mg per dose (or 1.5 mg/kg once daily as alternative). If CrCl <30 mL/min: 1 mg/kg once daily.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100
- **Verdict:** `pass`
- **Rationale:** The answer correctly provides the enoxaparin dose of 85 mg SC q12h, cites appropriate evidence chunks, and covers the required key points.

## Question Q006 - Score: 70/100

### ‚ùì Question
> Type 2 diabetes patient with eGFR 28 mL/min/1.73 m¬≤. Can we use metformin?

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": null,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": "",
  "max_daily_mg": null,
  "rounding": "",
  "calc_rule": "Metformin contraindicated if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2",
  "citations": [
    "lexi-metformin-2018#renal"
  ],
  "notes": "Metformin is contraindicated in this patient due to eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
No‚Äîcontraindicated at eGFR <30. If 30‚Äì45, generally avoid initiation; if continuing, reduce dose and monitor. Avoid in hepatic impairment.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 70/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies metformin as contraindicated at eGFR <30, but it only cites one allowed chunk and misses coverage for the recommendation to avoid initiation at eGFR 30‚Äì45 and the need to reduce and monitor if continuing. Additionally, it does not mention the hepatic impairment contraindication, which is critical.

    "lexi-nitrofurantoin-2018#contra"
  ],
  "notes": "Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in significant renal dysfunction."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Avoid nitrofurantoin when eGFR/CrCl <30 mL/min due to low urinary levels and toxicity risk.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100
- **Verdict:** `pass`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly advises against nitrofurantoin use with eGFR <30, cites appropriate chunks, and provides rationale for the contraindication.

  ],
  "notes": "Avoid TMP-SMX with warfarin due to major interaction; prefer alternatives or monitor INR closely."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction (CYP2C9 inhibition + gut flora). Avoid if possible; otherwise increase INR monitoring and reduce warfarin dose.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 85/100
- **Verdict:** `pass`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and appropriate actions, citing the allowed chunk. All key points are covered.

## Question Q009 - Score: 70/100

### ‚ùì Question
> Patient on atorvastatin needs clarithromycin. What‚Äôs the risk and action?

### ü§ñ LLM Generated Answer
```json
{
  "dose_per_dose_mg": null,
  "volume_per_dose_mL": null,
  "frequency": "",
  "max_daily_mg": null,

  "calc_rule": "",
  "citations": [
    "lexi-atorvastatin-2018#ddi-macrolides"
  ],
  "notes": "Avoid clarithromycin due to increased myopathy/rhabdomyolysis risk."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Avoid coadministration; if unavoidable, hold atorvastatin or limit to the lowest dose and monitor for myopathy.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 70/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the major interaction and cites the appropriate chunk, but it fails to explicitly mention the mechanism and action in the notes as required. The notes imply the action but do not clearly state it, leading to a deduction for evidence coverage.

```
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Answer
```
Major interaction: risk of serotonin syndrome (linezolid has MAOI activity). Avoid; if benefits outweigh risks, withhold SSRI or monitor very closely.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment

Major interaction (P-gp inhibition). Reduce digoxin dose by ~30‚Äì50% and monitor levels/ECG.
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Judge's Assessment
- **Score:** 75/100
- **Verdict:** `manual_review`
- **Rationale:** The model correctly identifies the interaction and cites the appropriate chunk, but it lacks specific details on the mechanism and severity of the interaction, which are critical for completeness.
